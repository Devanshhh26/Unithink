          <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            Flowbite is first conceptualized and designed using the Figma software so everything you see in the library
            has a design equivalent in our Figma file.

        <Accordion.Title>What are the differences between Flowbite and Tailwind UI?</Accordion.Title>
        <Accordion.Content>
          <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            The main difference is that the core components from Flowbite are open source under the MIT license, whereas
            Tailwind UI is a paid product. Another difference is that Flowbite relies on smaller and standalone
            components, whereas Tailwind UI offers sections of pages.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            However, we actually recommend using both Flowbite, Flowbite Pro, and even Tailwind UI as there is no
            technical reason stopping you from using the best of two worlds.
